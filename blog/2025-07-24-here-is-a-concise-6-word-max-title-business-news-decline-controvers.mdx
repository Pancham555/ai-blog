Business News: Decline, Controvers](https://picsum.photos/800/400?random=799)

**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

**Heathrow's Pre-Tax Profit Falls Amid Fire Disruption**

Heathrow Airport's pre-tax profit has fallen by 37.2% to Â£203m in the first six months of 2025, according to the airport's latest figures. The decline is attributed to a power outage that disrupted 1,300 flights, with Heathrow's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, admitting to being asleep during the incident. A review into the incident by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly found that Woldbye's actions were not typical of his usual behavior.

**Rate-Rigging Convictions Quashed for Two Former City Traders**

In a significant development, the convictions of two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have been quashed. The duo was jailed for manipulating interest rates, a scandal that was at the center of the financial crisis. The move has sparked concerns about the implications for the financial sector and the possibility of similar cases being reopened.

**Tesla Faces Significant Trouble Ahead**

Tesla's sales have been in decline over the last 18 months, with the company recording only one quarterly year-over-year sales drop before 2024. The company faces significant challenges ahead, including increased competition and regulatory issues. The decline in sales has been attributed to a range of factors, including the company's high prices and limited availability of certain models.

**PeakDo's Starlink Mini Power Bank Offers Ultra-Portable Solution**

In a bid to address the limitations of satellite internet, PeakDo has launched the LinkPower 1 power bank, which creates a battery-powered Starlink Mini that can be placed anywhere. The device offers 99 watt-hours of power and can be recharged using solar panels. The company claims that the device can be used to provide internet access in areas where traditional connectivity is limited or non-existent.

**Ukraine Protests Zelensky's Anti-Corruption Reforms**

Ukraine has seen widespread protests in response to President Zelensky's signing of a bill that targets anti-corruption bodies. The new law has sparked concern among Western allies, who fear that it will undermine the authority of the watchdogs. Critics argue that the move is at odds with more than a decade of pro-democracy and anti-corruption efforts, which led to the Euromaidan uprising and the downfall of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.

In conclusion, the business and artificial intelligence news this week is dominated by stories of decline and controversy. Heathrow Airport's pre-tax profit has fallen, while Tesla faces significant challenges ahead. In the world of AI, PeakDo has launched a new power bank that offers ultra-portable internet access. However, the news is not all positive, with protests erupting in Ukraine over President Zelensky's anti-corruption reforms.
