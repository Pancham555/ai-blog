**Trump's Conspiracy Theory Fires and Kamala Harris's Governor Run**

In recent news, USA Today has reported that former President Donald Trump may face backlash for spreading conspiracy theories. According to an article by Ezra Klein, Trump's supporters have been spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories, which may come back to haunt him. The article highlights the dangers of spreading false information and the impact it can have on society.

Meanwhile, in California, Democrats are debating whether Kamala Harris should run for governor or hold out for another presidential bid. According to an article by CNN, California Democrats are quietly asking themselves the same question. Rep. Dave Min was quoted as saying that he wants Kamala Harris to run for governor, while others are urging her to wait for another presidential bid.

**Dhaka Crash and Trump's Scottish Visit**

In other news, a tragic accident occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where a fighter jet crashed into a school, killing at least 31 people, including many schoolchildren. According to an article by BBC News, 11-year-old Wakia Firdous Nidhi was one of the survivors, who had walked to school that morning. Her father ran barefoot from the mosque as soon as he heard the crash.

On a separate note, US President Trump is back on the golf course for the second day of his Scottish visit. According to an article by BBC News, the US president will again play a round at Turnberry before meeting the EU Commission president for trade talks. A security checkpoint has been set up outside the hotel, and a large fence has been erected around the course. Several hundred demonstrators gathered in both Aberdeen and Edinburgh on Friday, protesting Trump's visit.

In the midst of Trump's Scottish visit, the US president also discussed the Thai-Cambodian conflict with the leaders of the two countries.
