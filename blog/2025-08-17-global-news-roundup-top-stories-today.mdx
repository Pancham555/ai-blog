**Global News Roundup: Data Breach, Magazine History, Racist Abuse, Train Crash, and High-Level Summit**

In this week's global news roundup, we bring you updates from various corners of the world. From a data breach affecting Afghans resettled in the UK to a train crash in Denmark, we've got you covered.

First up, a data breach has exposed the personal information of up to 3,700 Afghans who have been resettled in the UK. The breach occurred when a company working with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was targeted in a cyber-attack. In a statement, Inflite The Jet Centre said that the breach was limited to email accounts only and has reported the incident to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

In other news, CNN takes a trip down memory lane to explore the heyday of magazines. The article features top magazine editors and writers reminiscing about the luxurious and giddy era when magazines ruled the world. The focus is on John F. Kennedy Jr.'s magazine "George", which was launched 30 years ago.

Moving on to sports, Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo has reported receiving racist abuse from the crowd during a Premier League match at Liverpool. The Football Association has issued a statement expressing concern about the allegation and promising to investigate.

In a tragic incident, a train has derailed in southern Jutland, Denmark, after hitting a tanker carrying farm waste. One person has been killed and several others injured in the crash.

Finally, the highly anticipated summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken place in Alaska. The meeting yielded more questions than answers, with no ceasefire agreement and an invitation to Moscow. The two leaders made statements but declined to take questions from reporters.

Here are the key takeaways from the summit:

* No ceasefire agreement was reached.
* Putin extended an invitation to Trump to visit Moscow.
* The meeting was marked by a lack of transparency, with the leaders refusing to take questions from reporters.
* Putin and Trump discussed a range of issues, including nuclear disarmament and the situation in Ukraine.
