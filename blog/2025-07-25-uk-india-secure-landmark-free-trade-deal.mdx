**Business and Artificial Intelligence News: Recent Updates and Developments**

In recent news, the United Kingdom and India have secured a "landmark" free trade deal, expected to boost bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement, signed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, aims to reduce tariffs on goods and increase market access for both countries. Last year, trade between the UK and India totaled £42.6 billion.

In a separate development, concerns have been raised about the misuse of payment cards by asylum seekers in the UK. According to a report, more than 6,500 payments in gambling settings were attempted by asylum seekers in the past year. The report highlights the need for greater oversight and management of the ASPEN card system, which provides a limited weekly allowance to asylum seekers.

Tragedy struck in the Russian far east, where an Angara airlines An-24 plane carrying 49 people went down, leaving wreckage and fatalities in its wake. The plane had disappeared from radar as it approached an airport in Amur region, with authorities eventually locating the crash site on a hillside about 16 kilometers from Tynda.

In the world of politics and law, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissenting opinions have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing her of using a "casual and even disdainful" tone in her writings. In one notable instance, she referred to colleagues as "hubristic and senseless" and added sarcastic asides. While her opinions have provoked criticism, they have also drawn attention to the importance of dissenting voices in the legal system.

Finally, a report highlights the growing concern over student mental health in the UK. The number of students reporting mental health concerns is on the rise, leading to questions about the extent to which universities should take responsibility for addressing these issues. Experts suggest that part of the problem may be attributed to the "peak ages" for mental health concerns, typically occurring between the ages of 18 and 21.

These articles highlight a range of important issues, from international trade and economic development to concerns over asylum seekers and student mental health. They also underscore the importance of critical thinking and dissenting voices in the legal system, as well as the need for greater oversight and management in various areas of public policy.
