**Global Headlines: Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

In this article, we will summarize the latest news from around the world, covering topics such as business, artificial intelligence, and current events.

**Air Canada Resumes Flights After Strike**

Air Canada has announced that it will resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) acted on a directive from Canada's Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu to end the strike. The strike had resulted in significant disruptions to the airline's operations, with many flights cancelled or delayed. The resumption of flights is expected to bring relief to passengers and employees alike.

**Gaza City Under Attack**

Gaza City is facing a catastrophic situation as Israeli bombardment continues to cause widespread damage. According to the city's Hamas-run authority, 80% of the city's infrastructure has been damaged over nearly two years of Israeli attacks. The city's four remaining hospitals are operating at less than 50% capacity, making it difficult for residents to access medical care.

**Protests Continue in Serbia**

Protests in Serbia have entered their fifth night, with demonstrators demanding the resignation of President Vui's government. The protests were initially triggered by a railway station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16 people, with many blaming corruption and corner-cutting by the government for the tragedy. Russia has thrown its support behind the beleaguered president, warning that it will not "remain unresponsive" to the unrest.

**Palestine Action Ban Defended**

The UK government has defended its decision to ban the Palestine Action group, which has been accused of orchestrating violent protests. According to Yvette Cooper, the group is more than just a "regular protest group known for occasional stunts." More than 700 people have been arrested since the group was banned, including over 500 at a demonstration in central London last week.

**Claire's: The Chain That Defined Tween Culture**

Claire's, a popular chain of jewelry stores, is facing an uncertain future as the rise of online shopping and social media platforms like TikTok has changed the way young people shop. According to Ella Clancy, 29, Claire's was once the "ultimate shop for young people," where tweens could buy quirky accessories and express themselves. However, the chain's popularity has declined in recent years, and its future is now hanging in the balance.

These are just a few of the latest news stories from around the world. From business and artificial intelligence to current events and social issues, we will continue to bring you the latest updates and summaries to keep you informed and up-to-date.
