**Business and Artificial Intelligence News: WhatsApp Updates, Romantic Chance Encounter, New Art District, and Security Flaws**

In recent news, WhatsApp is discontinuing its native Windows app and switching to a web wrapper version instead. This change may not be met with enthusiasm from users, as the new web app is expected to be less aesthetically pleasing. On the other hand, a chance encounter between two strangers on a flight in 1982 led to a 40-year whirlwind romance, highlighting the power of serendipity. Additionally, Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Cultural District is set to become a hub for international art, featuring the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, as well as other institutions.

In more pressing news, thousands of on-premises servers used by global businesses and agencies have been exposed to a major security flaw in Microsoft's SharePoint software. This zero-day breach could have serious implications for those affected.

Lastly, Bryan Kohberger, who admitted to the killings of four University of Idaho students, may spend the rest of his life at Idaho's only maximum security prison, which has a notorious reputation for a botched execution and alleged insanitary conditions.

**WhatsApp Updates**

Meta is planning to drop its native WhatsApp Windows app in favor of a web wrapper version, a move that may not be well-received by users. According to the latest WhatsApp beta for Windows, significant changes are on the way, including the shift to a web wrapper version. This decision comes just months after the introduction of the native app.

**Romantic Chance Encounter**

Vickie Moretz, an American, got the last seat on a flight to the UK in 1982, where she met Englishman Graham Kidner. Four decades later, they share the story of a whirlwind romance that never stopped. This chance encounter highlights the power of serendipity and the importance of taking risks.

**New Art District**

Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Cultural District is set to become a hub for international art, featuring the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, as well as other institutions. The district will also include an immersive digital art space and a natural history museum, making it a must-visit destination for art lovers.

**Security Flaws**

Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft's SharePoint software, exposing thousands of on-premises servers used by global businesses and agencies. This zero-day breach could have serious implications for those affected, highlighting the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity.

**Prison Life**

Bryan Kohberger, who admitted to the killings of four University of Idaho students, may spend the rest of his life at Idaho's only maximum security prison, which has a notorious reputation for a botched execution and alleged insanitary conditions.
