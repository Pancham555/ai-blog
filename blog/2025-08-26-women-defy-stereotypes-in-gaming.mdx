**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

In recent news, a growing number of women are defying stereotypes by pursuing careers in gaming, with one Twitch streamer, Alyce Rocha, making a living by playing video games from the comfort of her own home. Meanwhile, the latest Powerball jackpot has reached $750 million, making it the 10th largest in the game's history.

In other news, the memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, is set to be published. Giuffre, who was a victim of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, had finished working on the book before her death. The memoir is described as "intimate" and "heartbreaking" and is expected to provide a unique perspective on her experiences.

In the world of politics, some Supreme Court justices have expressed frustration with lower courts, echoing the sentiments of former President Donald Trump. Trump has been critical of federal judges, and it appears that some of the nation's highest court justices share his concerns.

In a more somber note, a woman who murdered her family members with toxic mushrooms has appeared in court, where her victims' family members confronted her about the impact of her actions. The case has been described as "heart-wrenching" and has left many struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.
