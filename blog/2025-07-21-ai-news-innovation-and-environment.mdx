**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

This week's news roundup brings together a diverse range of stories from the worlds of business, technology, and environment. From the devastating floods in South Korea to the innovative use of handmade notes in a California rescue mission, we've got you covered.

**South Korea Floods Leave at Least 14 Dead**

In South Korea, heavy rainfall has triggered landslides and flooding, leaving at least 14 people dead and seven missing. The destruction has been widespread, with thousands of roads and buildings damaged or submerged by raging floodwaters. The hardest hit region is Sancheong, where six people have lost their lives.

**California Mother and Son Use Handwritten Notes to Lead Rescuers**

Meanwhile, in California, a mother and son were stranded in a remote forest after GPS led them off the path. However, their quick thinking and resourcefulness helped them use handwritten notes to guide rescuers to their location, just over 24 hours later. The pair, Tami Laird and her 9-year-old son Stirling, were stranded deep in the woods, miles from the nearest road, with no cell service and a car stuck in the rough terrain.

**Anker Nebula X1 Review: A Terrific Home Theater on the Go**

For those looking for a more enjoyable experience at home, The Verge has reviewed the Anker Nebula X1, a portable projector that boasts 4K resolution and immersive sound. With its ability to produce 3500 ANSI lumens, this device is perfect for outdoor use, making it ideal for vanlife, gaming, or simply setting up a home theater in a small space.

**The Rise of Green Tech Feeds Another Environmental Crisis**

In environmental news, the world's rush to decarbonize has led to a surge in demand for lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries. However, this increased demand has also led to concerns about the environmental impact of lithium mining. Faviola Gonzalez, a biologist from the local indigenous community in the Atacama Desert, is working to raise awareness about the importance of responsible mining practices.

**Shorter Summer School Holidays: A Good Idea?**

Finally, the BBC has sparked a debate about the length of summer school holidays. While six weeks may seem like a long time for parents, are shorter breaks a good idea? The cost of traveling during peak season can be prohibitively expensive, and some argue that shorter holidays would reduce the financial burden on families.

In conclusion, this week's news roundup highlights the importance of innovation, resourcefulness, and responsible decision-making in various industries. From the devastating floods in South Korea to the innovative use of handwritten notes in a California rescue mission, and from the rise of green tech to the debate about summer school holidays, there's no shortage of exciting and thought-provoking stories to keep you informed.
