**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

**Military Bases and the Threat of Internal Threats**

US military bases, once seen as fortresses guarding against external threats, are now facing a new challenge - threats from within. A recent shooting incident at Fort Stewart, a US military base in Georgia, has exposed the vulnerability of these bases to internal threats. Fort Stewart, which houses the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, a premier fighting force of around 20,000 soldiers, has been accustomed to guarding against external threats. However, experts say that this incident highlights the need for military bases to be equipped to handle internal threats as well.

**Lifeboat Rescues Woman from Sea Off Skegness Beach**

In a separate incident, a woman in her 60s has died after being rescued from the sea off Skegness beach. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) scrambled a lifeboat as part of a major search effort, which also involved a coastguard helicopter and an air ambulance. The woman was given CPR after being pulled from the water, but sadly, she did not survive.

**Israel Rejects International Criticism of Gaza City Takeover Plan**

Meanwhile, Israel has rejected international criticism of its plan to take over Gaza City. The plan, approved by the Israeli security cabinet, outlines five principles for ending the war with Hamas, including disarming the group, returning all hostages, and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip. Israel's defense minister has said that countries that condemn Israel and threaten sanctions will not weaken the country's resolve.

**Is Super Skinny Back? UK Sees Rise in Complaints Over Thin Models**

In a different context, the UK is seeing a rise in complaints over thin models. Recently, several major retailers, including Zara, M&S, and Next, had ads banned over models that looked "unhealthily thin". This has led to a renewed debate about the appropriateness of using extremely thin models in advertising. Model and activist Charli Howard, who was dropped by her modeling agency for being "too big" despite being a UK size six to eight, has spoken out about the issue. She believes that the industry is still struggling to move away from the "size zero" ideal.

**Working Class Students Divided on Civil Service Summer Internship Reform**

Finally, a recent survey of working class students has found that they are divided on the proposed reform of the civil service's summer internship program. The program, which is designed to provide opportunities for young people from low-income backgrounds to gain work experience, has been criticized for being inaccessible to many students from disadvantaged backgrounds. A survey of four students found that while some were supportive of the reforms, others were skeptical about their effectiveness.

These five articles highlight some of the current issues and debates in the world of business and artificial intelligence. From the vulnerability of military bases to internal threats, to the ongoing debate about the use of thin models in advertising, and the challenges faced by working class students in gaining access to internships, these articles provide a snapshot of the complex and rapidly changing world we live in.
