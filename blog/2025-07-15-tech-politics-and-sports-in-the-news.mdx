Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama issued a call to action for Democrats, urging them to "stand up for the things that you think are right" and "toughen up" in the face of adversity. His message came at a private fundraiser in New Jersey, where he urged Democrats to take a stand against the current administration.

In the world of sports, Chinese swimmers took more anti-doping tests than swimmers from any other country ahead of the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.
