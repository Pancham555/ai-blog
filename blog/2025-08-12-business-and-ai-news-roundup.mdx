**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

In this week's roundup of business and AI news, we bring you a mix of stories from around the world. From a British man found 65 years after his disappearance in Antarctica to a toy shop chain being given away to its staff, there's a lot to catch up on.

First up, a remarkable story of perseverance and determination. 65 years after his disappearance, a British man who perished in an Antarctic glacier has been found. David's brother told BBC News that he had lost hope of ever finding his sibling, but thanks to the efforts of the British Antarctic Monument Trust, the body has been located. Since 1944, 29 people have died working on British Antarctic Territory on scientific missions, making this discovery all the more significant.

In a heartwarming story, the founder of a toy shop chain has given the business to its 1,900 staff members. This means that the employees will now have a share of the profits and a say in how the company is run. The move is seen as a sign of trust and empowerment, and is likely to boost morale and motivation among the staff.

In the world of education, a new report from CNN highlights the challenges faced by college leaders in the United States. Despite settlements by prominent schools, many institutional leaders seem to have lost their voice in addressing the Trump administration's ongoing battle with elite higher education. The report highlights the importance of student voices being heard in this battle.

In the tech world, two major chip giants, Nvidia and AMD, have agreed to pay 15% of their China chip sales to the US government. This move is seen as a way for the companies to gain access to the Chinese market, which has been restricted due to export control rules.

Finally, in a incident that could have had serious consequences, a Delta Airlines plane traveling to Guatemala clipped the wing of an empty jet during pushback from a gate at Atlanta's airport. The airline has apologized for the incident and is investigating the cause.
