**Prisoner Breaks Free in France**

In a daring escape, a man in France hid in a bag belonging to his cellmate who was being released from prison, according to an official told local media.

**DR Congo's M23 Conflict: Rebels Give BBC Rare Access to a Mine**

The Democratic Republic of Congo's M23 conflict has been ongoing for years, with the US seeking rights to the country's minerals. In a rare move, the rebels gave the BBC access to a vital mine that powers mobile phones. The mine, located in the Rubaya area, is still under rebel control, and the supervisor expressed willingness to welcome foreign investment, but only if it benefits the local economy and creates jobs, schools, and hospitals.

**The People Wrongly Accused of Cutting Down the Sycamore Gap Tree**

In a bizarre incident, two individuals, including a teenager, were arrested and accused of cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland, England. However, after several weeks, the police concluded that there was no evidence to support the allegations, and the pair was released without charge. One of the accused, Walter Renwick, even wore a Rod Stewart wig to hide his identity while under suspicion.

**Russia's Agents Killed after Intelligence Officer Shot Dead**

In a separate incident, Ukraine accused Russia of killing two individuals who were allegedly working for the country's intelligence agency. The two men were shot dead in Kyiv, and CCTV footage showed one of them leaving a building shortly before the incident.
