**Global Conflict and Crisis Updates**

As tensions continue to rise between Israel and Hamas, a recent video released by Hamas showing an emaciated Israeli hostage has sparked outrage and condemnation from the hostage's family. The Israeli government has denied allegations that it is weaponizing food to starve Gaza, with officials claiming there is "no starvation" in the region. However, aid agencies have expressed concerns that the conflict is pushing Gaza towards famine.

In other news, the city of Flint, Michigan, has declared its water safe to drink after replacing lead pipes, but many residents remain skeptical and refuse to consume the water without a filter. Eleven years ago, Flint's water crisis made international headlines when toxic levels of lead were discovered in the city's water supply, leading to widespread health problems and a major public health crisis.

Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, a Ukrainian drone attack on an oil depot in Russia's former Olympic city of Sochi has sparked a massive fire, with over 120 firefighters attempting to extinguish the blaze. The Russian government has blamed the attack on Ukraine, while Ukraine has denied any involvement.

**Conflict Escalates in Ukraine**

In a separate incident, Ukraine has reported that a Russian missile strike has destroyed homes and civilian infrastructure in the southern city of Mykolaiv, injuring at least three civilians. The strike is the latest in a series of attacks on Ukrainian cities, with both sides accusing each other of aggression.

**Fashion Trends and Safety Concerns**

In a more lighthearted note, tan lines are back in fashion, with many embracing the retro trend. However, experts are warning that the rise of tan lines could fuel dangerous sunburn habits, particularly among young people. The trend has sparked a debate about the importance of sun protection and the need for safe and responsible sunbathing practices.
