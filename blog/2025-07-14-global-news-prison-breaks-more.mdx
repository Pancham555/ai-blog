**Global Updates: Prison Break, Mineral Mining, Wrongful Accusations, and Intelligence Operations**

In today's edition, we bring you a selection of news stories from around the world, covering a range of topics, from a daring prison break in France to mineral mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, wrongful accusations in the UK, and a tragic incident involving Russian agents in Ukraine.

**Prison Break in France**

In a surprising turn of events, a man has escaped from a prison in France by hiding in a bag belonging to his cellmate who was being released after finishing his sentence. According to SÃ©bastien Cauwel, the director of the prison, the escaped prisoner was able to blend in with his cellmate's belongings and avoid detection. The incident is currently under investigation.

**Mineral Mining in DR Congo**

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the US has been seeking rights to the country's mineral resources. However, one vital mine remains in the hands of rebels. A recent report by the BBC gives rare access to the Rubaya mine, which powers mobile phones. The mine's supervisor expressed willingness to welcome foreign investors, but only if they prioritize boosting the local economy through job creation, schools, and hospitals.

**Wrongful Accusations in the UK**

In the UK, two individuals were wrongly accused of cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree. Walter Renwick, one of the accused, claimed to have worn a "Rod Stewart" wig to hide his identity while under suspicion. Northumbria Police have since concluded that no further action will be taken against the pair, after it took them several weeks to clear their names.

**Intelligence Operations in Ukraine**

In Ukraine, authorities have accused two individuals of working for Russia and shooting dead a Ukrainian intelligence officer. CCTV footage shows a man leaving a building in Kyiv shortly after the incident, which was verified by Reuters. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia.

**Summer Holidays on a Budget**

Finally, in a more lighthearted note, the BBC shares tips on how to save hundreds of pounds on summer holiday bookings. From house swapping to smart searching, readers have been sharing their secrets to getting away for less. One example is May Burrough, who works in central London and saved money by inviting friends to stay in a five-bedroomed villa in Costa Brava.

These stories demonstrate the complexities and diversities of global news, from daring prison breaks to mineral mining, wrongful accusations, and intelligence operations.
