The leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has vowed to protect the Druze minority community in the country following a recent outbreak of sectarian violence that prompted Israeli airstrikes. The Druze religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs, and there are sizeable communities of Druze in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and the occupied Golan Heights. The violence was sparked by allegations of government forces attacking Druze civilians, leading Israel to threaten to destroy government forces if they did not cease their actions.
