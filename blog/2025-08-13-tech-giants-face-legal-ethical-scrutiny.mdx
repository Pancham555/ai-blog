**Business and Artificial Intelligence News and Current Updates**

In recent news, there have been several developments in the world of business and artificial intelligence. Here are some of the latest updates:

**Epic Games vs. Apple and Google**

In a significant ruling, a federal court in Australia has ordered Apple and Google to allow Epic Games' popular game, Fortnite, to return to their app marketplaces. The decision comes after the court found that Apple and Google's app marketplaces are anticompetitive. This is a major win for Epic Games, which has been locked in a legal battle with the two tech giants over their app store policies. The ruling could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry, and may pave the way for more competition in the market.

**AI in Police Stations**

Police departments across the United States are adopting an AI tool called Draft One, which helps officers write the first draft of police reports. While the tool is designed to streamline the reporting process and reduce errors, there are concerns that AI-drafted reports could contain biases or inaccuracies. This raises important questions about the use of AI in the criminal justice system, and the potential for bias and discrimination.

**Republicans and Obamacare**

Despite no longer promising to repeal Obamacare, Republicans are quietly working to dismantle the landmark health reform law. According to reports, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are using regulatory changes and other means to weaken the law and make it harder for people to access affordable healthcare. This is a concerning development, and highlights the ongoing efforts to undermine the healthcare system in the United States.

**Killer's Identity Protected**

In a separate story, the identity of a 15-year-old boy who was convicted of murder in the UK has been protected due to his age. The boy's name will not be released, despite calls from the victim's family for him to be named and shamed. This raises important questions about the treatment of minors who commit crimes, and the balance between accountability and privacy.

**South China Sea Collision**

Finally, in international news, a Chinese warship has collided with one of its own coast guard vessels while chasing Philippine boats in the South China Sea. The incident highlights the growing tensions in the region, and the ongoing competition for power and resources. It also raises concerns about the safety of shipping and navigation in the area.

In conclusion, these stories highlight some of the latest developments in the world of business and artificial intelligence. From the Epic Games vs. Apple and Google lawsuit to the use of AI in police stations, and from the efforts to dismantle Obamacare to the growing tensions in the South China Sea, these stories demonstrate the complexity and diversity of the issues we face today.
