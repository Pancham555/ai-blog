For the past 32 years, the Fed's decisions on interest rates have been unanimous, with only occasional dissent from a lone policymaker. However, this week's decision may not be as straightforward. The uncertainty surrounding the decision is attributed to the changing economic landscape and the Fed's efforts to balance growth and inflation.

The family is advocating for stricter safety measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
